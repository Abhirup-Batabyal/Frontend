        <h2>Layer 1: Explore the Beauty of Nature</h2>
        <p>
            The mountains stand tall, whispering stories of old. The wind carries echoes of adventurers who dared to climb their peaks.
            Parallax scrolling creates an illusion of depth, immersing you in the scene.

            Nature is vast, ever-changing, and full of surprises. Look closely, and you'll notice how each element moves at a different speed, 
            bringing a sense of motion and realism to the design.

        <h2>Layer 2: The Tranquility of the Forest</h2>
        <p>
            Deep within the forest, time slows down. The gentle rustling of leaves, the soft chirping of birds—it all blends into a melody of peace.
            This effect simulates the slow movement of background objects compared to the foreground.

        <p>
            Scroll down and observe how the layers of content create a mesmerizing effect. 
            The background moves slower than the text, making the experience immersive and engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
            Parallax scrolling is a web design technique that adds depth and interaction to a webpage. 
            By adjusting the speed at which elements move, we can guide the user's focus and create a dynamic browsing experience.
